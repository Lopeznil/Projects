# Profitability Insights and Delivery Risk Prediction in E-Commerce

## Project Overview

This project explores the key drivers of order profitability and late delivery risk in an e-commerce business. Using detailed order-level data, we analyze how variables such as product category, shipping mode, and quantity affect profit margins. We also build a predictive model to classify orders at risk of late delivery, leveraging features like scheduled shipment days, shipping method, and regional attributes.

The goal is to uncover high-margin segments, flag unprofitable patterns, and provide a data-driven foundation for improving operational efficiency. The findings support smarter product pricing, better carrier selection, and proactive delivery risk mitigation.


## Summary

- This report analyzes a total of 180,519 orders, generating a combined profit of $3,966,903. The average profit margin across all orders is 10.78%. 
- The most profitable product category Fishing, under consumers; contributing 19% of total profit. 
- The shipping mode most associated with late delivery is First Class, where late delivery risk is 95%.

## Data Overview

The dataset contains detailed records of transactions and supply chain operations from DataCo Global, covering multiple product categories including Clothing, Sports, and Electronic Supplies. The data spans the full order lifecycleâ€”from customer details and purchase behavior to shipping logistics and profit metrics.

It includes 52 structured fields such as product category, customer location, shipping dates, delivery status, order profit, and pricing. Key variables like "Late delivery risk", "Benefit per order", and "Shipping mode" support analysis of operational performance and customer behavior.

This structured dataset was analyzed to understand inefficiencies across provisioning, production, and distribution processes, enabling insights into delivery delays, profit margins, and customer segmentation. It is particularly suited for advanced analytics and machine learning models to optimize supply chain operations and forecast demand patterns.

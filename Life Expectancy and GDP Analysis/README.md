# Introduction

This project will investigate if there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens. The goals are to prepare data, followed by analysis with plots, and seek to explain the findings from the study.

**Data sources**

- GDP Source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.

- Life expectancy Data Source: [World Health Organization](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688)

### Project Goals

This project aims to analyze the relationship between a country's economic output (GDP) and the life expectancy of its citizens. By examining data from different nations, the study will explore trends over time and assess potential correlations between these two key indicators. Through data preparation, visualization, and interpretation, this project seeks to provide insights into the potential link between economic prosperity and public health outcomes. Some questions that are posed:

+ Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
+ Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
+ Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
+ What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
+ What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

### Data

The `csv` file has information about each nations GDP insurance and Life expectancy. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project.

### Analysis

In this section, we analyze the relationship between GDP and life expectancy by exploring trends and correlations across six nations. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include:

1. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate the average life expectancy in the selected nations and analyze its distribution.
1. Correlation Assessment: Determine whether a strong correlation exists between GDP and life expectancy.
1. Data Visualization: Utilize plots to illustrate trends, distributions, and relationships between variables.

### Evaluation

Lastly, it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies.

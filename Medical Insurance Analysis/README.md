# Introduction

This goal of this project will be to analyze various attributes within `insurance.csv` to learn more about the patient information in the file and gain insight into potential use cases for the dataset. A CSV file with medical insurance costs will be investigated using Python fundamentals.

**Data sources:**

Data was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).

Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional.

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to analyze various attributes within the insurance.csv dataset to gain insights into patient demographics, health factors, and their impact on medical insurance charges. By leveraging Python for data exploration, visualization, and potential predictive modeling, this analysis aims to identify key trends, correlations, and risk factors that influence insurance costs. Some questions that are posed:

- Are there significant differences in insurance costs based on gender?
- Is there a correlation between BMI and insurance charges?
- Do smokers pay significantly more for insurance compared to non-smokers?
- Can we predict insurance charges based on patient attributes?

### Data

The `csv` file has information about individual's insurance and another various other health factors or demograhpics associated. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project.

### Analysis

In this section, descriptive statistics and predictive modeling techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include:

1. Distributions
1. Correlation between insurance charges and independent variables
1. Feature importance analysis to determine key drivers of insurance costs.

### Evaluation

Lastly, it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies.

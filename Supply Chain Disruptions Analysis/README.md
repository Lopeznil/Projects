### Project Goals

This project explores the impact of global supply chain disruptions on delivery performance and inventory levels across key industries. 

The coronavirus presented unique challenges to supply chains worldwide. As cities and states rise to meet challenges its important to know where critical items are produced and to try and understand the impact of these closures on the US supply chain. This can be especially important at the moment with regards to manufacturing capabilities related to medical devices and pharmaceuticals. 

The goal of this project to is create a Scenario Planning Dashboard (Simulate what-if scenarios (e.g., "impact of closures") and visualize their financial/supply chain impact.) based on CFS data conducted in 1993, 1997, 2002, 2007 and most recently in 2012.

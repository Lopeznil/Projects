### Project Goals

This project explores the key drivers of order profitability and late delivery risk in an e-commerce business. Using detailed order-level data, we analyze how variables such as product category, shipping mode, and quantity affect profit margins. We also build a predictive model to classify orders at risk of late delivery, leveraging features like scheduled shipment days, shipping method, and regional attributes.

The goal is to uncover high-margin segments, flag unprofitable patterns, and provide a data-driven foundation for improving operational efficiency. The findings support smarter product pricing, better carrier selection, and proactive delivery risk mitigation.

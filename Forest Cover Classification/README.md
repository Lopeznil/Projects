# Introduction

This project will build a deep learning model to predict the forest cover type from different cartographic variables:

**Cover Types:**
- Spruce/Fir
- Lodgepole Pine
- Ponderosa Pine
- Cottonwood/Willow
- Aspen
- Douglas-fir
- Krummholz

**Data sources**

Data was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com)

Note: The data for this project is inspired by real data, but is mostly fictional.

### Project Goals
 No separate test dataset provided, so a portion of the input must be held out as test data. Prediction Focus: No information on whether to prioritize precision or recall, so both should be maximized.

### Data

The `cover_data.csv` file contains 581,012 observations, each observation has 55 columns (54 features and the last one being the class).

### Evaluation
+ A high-performing deep learning model.
+ Performance metrics over epochs (accuracy and loss plots).
+ Classification metrics:
    1. Heatmap of the confusion matrix
    2. Classification report
+ Conclusions, thoughts, and suggestions for improving classification accuracy.
